        <section>Grocery List</section>
        <p>The grocery list was a project designed to test the basics of html and css. The project required students to create a grocery list using inline-block elements and various stylings. The most  challenging part was properly organizing the block elements so that they appeared side-by-side and had appropriate padding. </p>
        <section>My first website</section>
        <p>This was one of the first assignments we had, the purpose was to practice html basics such as headers, paragraphs, and linking to a css file. Some very basic css was introduced here as well. </p>
        <section>Zoo problem</section>
        <p>The Zoo problem project had similar requirements as the grocery list, but was more extensive and required careful management of linked images.</p>
