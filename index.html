      <h2>Personal Trainer, Coding student</h2>
      <p>
        My name is Daniel Simmons, and I'm pursuing a career in coding. I have
        many interests and I always look to find something new to learn about. I
        have a competitive side that comes out for just about everything. I also
        love working with people, as I find I can connect with a lot of
        different demographics.
