        <section>Lifting</section>
        <p>I got into weight lifting during my senior year of high school, however, I had been doing calisthenics for much longer. I actually didn't play any sports in high school, I just discovered I loved the benefits and feeling of lifting heavy weights. Since then, I've actively studied resistance training and even became a personal trainer for a while. My favorite lifts are the deadlift and bench press.</p>
        <section>Exploring</section>
        <p>One of my favorite activities is to go to a new area and see all the things it has to offer. This has no limits either, it can be any place from just a park to a whole city. If I'm exploring outdoors, I like to use apps and field guides to find different plants and birds and learn about them, since every area has different organisms native to it. I find that it makes you feel much more connected to the world and your surroundings.</p>
        <section>Sports and Gaming</section>
        <p>Although I did not play sports in high school, I got very into recreational sports during my college years. I like to play volleyball and tennis a lot and I'm always willing to try new things. I'm very competitive and I love to get better at things I'm bad at. This goes to show that you're never too old to pick up a sport, or really any hobby. I also love playing video games with friends, I find it's a fantastic social activity and it scratches that competitive itch even if my body is tired.</p>
